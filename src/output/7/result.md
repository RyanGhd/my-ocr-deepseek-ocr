# REACHOUT  


Doritos believes it's good to talk.  


Almost 40% of young people have difficulty with their mental health; starting to talk about what's going on for you is the first bold move towards (feeling better).  


That's why Doritos supports ReachOut.  


ReachOut helps (young people) (and their parents) feel better by providing a (safe place) where they can openly express themselves, explore what's happening in their lives, and connect with people who understand their situation.  


Since 2022, Doritos has helped more than 200,000 people take action for their mental health as part of its partnership with ReachOut.  


Lost your crunch?  


Be bold. ReachOut.
